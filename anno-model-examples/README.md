anno-model-examples
===================

There are two very similar sets of examples:
* Those for the Annotatoion __Protocol__, which ship in this repo
  (see [../README.md](../README.md)).
* Those in the [Annotatoion __Data Model__ spec][anno-model].

  [anno-model]: https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/

This directory is about the latter.

Due to license reasons, I cannot currently ship them directly.
Instead, you can use the [downloader](download.sh) to obtain them.

Then use `match_pairs.sh` to find matching pairs,
or `diff_pairs.sh` to create diff files for matching pairs.
